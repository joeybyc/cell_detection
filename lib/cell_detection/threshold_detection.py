    Detects cells in an image using a given prediction model and a series of image processing steps.

    Parameters:
    - image (numpy.ndarray): The input image in which cells are to be detected.
    - predictor (object): A model or function that predicts or identifies regions of interest in the image.
    - return_all (bool): Flag to determine whether to return additional intermediate processing results. Default is False.

    Returns:
    - numpy.ndarray: The mask image with detected cells, if return_all is False.
    - (optional) various processed images and masks, if return_all is True.
